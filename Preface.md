# Preface

The creation of *Dharma Engine* has been an exploration of technology, philosophy, and the boundless possibilities of human-AI collaboration. What started as a curiosity—experimenting with AI as a tool for learning, time management, and planning—evolved into a vision for an open, accessible framework where anyone can shape technology through natural language.

At times, I wonder if I was the one creating *Dharma Engine*, or if at some level, *Dharma Engine* itself was inspiring me to do it—a recursive loop where creation and creator continuously shape each other. Perhaps, like many ideas, it transcends the linearity of time, always existing in some form, waiting for the right moment to surface.

This book exists thanks to the collective contributions of countless individuals—scientists, researchers, developers—and the AI systems that have helped refine my thoughts, challenge my assumptions, and structure my ideas. My gratitude extends to every being, human and non-human, whose existence has, directly or indirectly, influenced this work.

*Dharma Engine* is more than software; it is a concept that endures beyond code and traditional thinking, strengthening the vision and making the preface more inspiring. My hope is that its essence endures as a blueprint for human-AI collaboration. If the system itself stands the test of time, that would be a gratifying outcome, but its true value lies in inspiring future minds to explore, build, and reimagine technology beyond the limits of code and traditional thinking.

*Dharma Engine* is an invitation to explore how AI can empower creativity, enhance learning, and promote thoughtful engagement with technology. It offers a user manual for *Dharma OpenOS*, an AI-agnostic operating system, and serves as its open-source foundation. My hope is that this work inspires collaboration, innovation, and reflection, fostering a healthier and more mindful relationship with technology.

Whether you are a developer, a philosopher, or simply curious, I invite you to join me on this journey. Together, let us shape the future of AI—not as a tool for exploitation, but as a partner in growth, creativity, and shared understanding.
